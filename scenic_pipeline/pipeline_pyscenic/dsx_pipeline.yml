# my estimates are that the RAM needs for this grn step are 0.28-0.32GB/cell/core plus the size of the input data
# this is based on:
#     - 178K cells with 10 cores uses ~500GB ram
#     - 178K cells with 8 cores uses ~400GB ram
#     - 178K cells with 4 cores uses ~220GB ram
#
# but:
#     - 66K cells with 5 cores uses ~55GB ram    ~0.17GB/1Kcell/core
#     - 55K cells with 5 cores uses ~40GB ram    ~0.15GB/1Kcell/core
#
#
#
#
# so the whole meta cb with 330K cells would need at least ~100GB per core
#
#
# 8 cores for the 178K cells seemed like it would finish within a week
# no idea about the 330K cells though ...
